# FOXSI3-analysis

Contains commands and procedures used for the analysis of the active region target in FOXSI-3 (target 1 and 4).

Frame number 363769 is weird = frame_counter value is to high and HV value is 70 (134 is expected)
In the analysis we will exclude this frame

HV start ramping at frame number 358509 = this is +30sec

target 1 indices       363858      364045
target 2 indices       364046      364095
target 3 indices       364096      364342
target 4 indices       364343      364433

Assuming 4 sec lag at beginning of the target and 2 seconds uncertainty at the end

target 1 indices       363860      364042
target 2 indices       364048      364091
target 3 indices       364101      364339
target 4 indices       364351      364432

To go to level 2, need calibration file, named as 'peaks_det108.sav'
==> ask Athiray
